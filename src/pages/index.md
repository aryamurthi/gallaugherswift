  title: Overview
  description: >
    In this fast-paced course, students will learn the Swift programming language and iOS app development skills. 
    While this course is rigorous, challenging, and covers a broad set of topics at a rapid pace, the course assumes NO prior programming experience.

  Using a "flipped-classroom" approach, students take lectures in a series of online videos embedded in a web-based course/reference/quiz book, following along with videos as they learn programming concepts and build apps. Although this is a flipped class, expect a challenging course. Class is mandatory (this is NOT an online course) and class time will be used for additional exercises, concept review, and student questions.Students should be prepared to spend significant time each week on self-directed learning and regular programming projects. This course can be used in place of ISYS 2157 Programming for Management for credit toward the Information Systems concentration. Make sure to bring the following:
